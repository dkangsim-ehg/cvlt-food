# cvlt-food (verbal list learning task with food words)
Modified Food Version of California Verbal Learning Test-II 
Scoring CVLT-Food: The goal of this project is to create a food version of the CVLT (VLLT-food) that can assess working memory and episodic memory for food and non-food specific stimuli. Such an instrument can be used both to measure contextual memory impairments accurately within this population and to determine if a given intervention results in improvements to memory. In addition, the controlled inclusion of food and non-food categories will allow researchers to determine if there are differential intervention effects on food and general stimuli. 

>Due to the copyright materials of the CVLT-II normative standards, the scoring code does not include matching counts with the normative standards as listed in the CVLT-II manual. Interested researchers are encouraged to refer to the normative standards by age and sex as listed in the appendix of the manual. The shared code is also limited to counts and their related indices. Scoring for learning characteristics and recongition indices are not included, but feasible.
