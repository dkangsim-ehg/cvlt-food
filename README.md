# cvlt-food (verbal list learning task with food words)
Modified Food Version of California Verbal Learning Test-II 
Scoring CVLT-Food: The goal of this project is to create a food version of the CVLT (VLLT-food) that can assess working memory and episodic memory for food and non-food specific stimuli. Such an instrument can be used both to measure contextual memory impairments accurately within this population and to determine if a given intervention results in improvements to memory. In addition, the controlled inclusion of food and non-food categories will allow researchers to determine if there are differential intervention effects on food and general stimuli.
